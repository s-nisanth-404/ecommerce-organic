              Organic food, fresh or processed food produced by organic farming
              methods. Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic
              chemicals, such as human-made pesticides and fertilizers, and does
              not contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic foods
              include fresh produce, meats, and dairy products as well as
              processed foods such as crackers, drinks, and frozen meals. The
              market for organic food has grown significantly since the late
              20th century, becoming a multibillion dollar industry with
              distinct production, processing, distribution, and retail systems.

            <h2>The benefits of organic food</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="page3-paragraph">
            <p class="animator">
              How your food is grown or raised can have a major impact on your
              mental and emotional health as well as the environment. Organic
              foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants,
              than their conventionally-grown counterparts and people with
              allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives may find their
              symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only organic foods.
            </p>

            <p class="animator">
              Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as
              synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used
              in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the
              food we eat.
              <img

                loading="lazy"
              />
            </p>

            <p class="animator">
              Organic food is often fresher because it doesn’t contain
              preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is
              sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on
              smaller farms nearer to where it is sold.
            </p>

            <p class="animator">
              Organic farming tends to be better for the environment. Organic
              farming practices may reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce
              soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy.
              Farming without synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby
              birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms.
            </p>

            <p class="animator">
              Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth
              hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock animal
              byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use
              of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of
              bacteria. Organically-raised animals tend to be given more space
              to move around and access to the outdoors, which help to keep them
              healthy.

              Organic meat and milk can be richer in certain nutrients. Results
              of a 2016 European study show that levels of certain nutrients,
              including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in
              organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions.

              Organic food is GMO-free. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or
              genetically engineered (GE) foods are plants whose DNA has been
              altered in ways that cannot occur in nature or in traditional
              crossbreeding, most commonly in order to be resistant to
              pesticides or produce an insecticide.
